# History_Blog_Site

this is a simple home for a fictional website called Herodote, focused on World History articles. The purpose of it was just for practicing Backend (HTML and CSS), therefore the site is static
and the anchors don´t redirect to anywhere. Despite that, i plan or developing one of the featured articles and the login form. Not just that, but i could even add some JavaScript Features related to the login.
